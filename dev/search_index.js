Masses of isotopes are normally given in terms of the atomic mass unit m_mathrmu=1661times 10^-24mathrmg, defined as 112 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom. The mass of a hydrogen atom is m_mathrmH=1007825m_mathrmu and that of a helium atom is m_mathrmHe=4002602 m_mathrmu, such that if four hydrogen atoms are fused into a helium atom there is a mass deficit leading to a release of energy (4m_mathrmH-m_mathrmHe)c^2sim 4times 10^-5mathrmerg. With this information, estimate the lifetime of the Sun as a core-hydrogen burning star.

In that case the sun has radiated a total energy sim E_g and we can compute the time it has taken to do so dividing by its luminosity. The resulting timescale is known as the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale,\ndisplaystyletau_mathrmKH = fracGM_odot^2R_odot L_odotsim frac6times 10^-8 cdot(2times 10^33)^27times 10^10cdot 4times 10^33 mathrms\nWe care about orders of magnitude, so we can eliminate nearly equal factors,\ndisplaystyletau_mathrmKH sim fraccancel6times 10^-8 cdot cancel4times 10^66cancel7times 10^10cdot cancel4times 10^33 mathrms = 10^15mathrms\nThat is a lot of seconds. It is easier to read in terms of years. Approximately, 1mathrmyr=3times 10^7mathrms, so\ndisplaystyletau_mathrmKH sim frac10^153times 10^7mathrmyr = frac1310^8mathrmyrsim 3times 10^7mathrmyr\nwhere I used that 13sim 3times 10^-1. The thermal timescale is then of the order of tens of millions of years, much shorter than the age of the Sun. Before it was understood that the Sun was powered by hydrogen fusion it was the accepted model that gravitational contraction was its energy source, but as the age of the Earth became constrained through radiometric dating, it was seen that that could not possibly be the case. One small caveat that we will see later on is that part of the gravitational energy is not radiated, but rather heats up the star. However, this only lowers the timescale by a factor of sim 2.\nDynamical timescale: The surface gravity of the Sun is g=GM_odotR_odot^2.   An object falling during a time t with a constant acceleration, and starting   at rest, travels a distance\ndisplaystyle d=frac12gt^2\nWe get the dynamical timescale by equating this to the solar radii, and naming the time t as tau_mathrmdyn\ndisplaystyle tau_mathrmdyn=sqrtfrac2R_odotg=sqrtfrac2R_odot^3GM_odottag1\nThe ratio M_odotR_odot^3 is (except for a constant factor), equal to the average density of the Sun langle rho rangle_odot, so often the dynamical timescale of a star is expressed as\ndisplaystyle tau_mathrmdynsimsqrtfrac1Glangle rho rangle_odot\nGoing back to Equation (1), let's evaluate it:\ndisplaystyle tau_mathrmdynsim sqrtfrac2cdot 7^3times 10^306times 10^-8cdot 2times 10^33mathrms\nAgain, we are doing an order of magnitude calculation, so we play a bit freely with elimination of terms,\ndisplaystyle tau_mathrmdynsimsqrtfraccancel2cdot 7^cancel32times 10^30cancel6times 10^-8cdot cancel2times 10^33mathrmssim sqrt7^2times 10^5mathrms\nOne can approximate 10^05sim 3 to obtain\ndisplaystyle tau_mathrmdynsim 7times 3times 10^2mathrmssim 2times 10^3mathrms\nWhich is about half an hour. We see that the timescale for dynamical adjustments is dramatically lower than the timescale for thermal adjustments!\nNuclear timescale: The number of hydrogen atoms that will be burned is given by\ndisplaystyle N=01fracM_odotm_mathrmH\nand the energy released per hydrogen atom that is burned is 10^-5mathrmerg. The Nuclear timescale can then be estimated as:\ndisplaystyle tau_mathrmnuc=fracNtimes 10^-5mathrmergL_odot\nLet's evaluate this, using m_mathrmHsim 2times 10^-24 for simplicity,\ndisplaystyle tau_mathrmnucsimfrac10^-1cdot 2times 10^33cdot 10^-52times 10^-24cdot 4 times 10^33sim frac12times 10^18mathrms\nAgain, that's a lot of seconds. Let's write it in years:\ndisplaystyle tau_mathrmnucsim frac(12)times 10^183times 10^7mathrmyr=frac16times 10^11mathrmyrsim 20 mathrmGyr\nWhere I have expressed the final result in units of Gigayears (equal to 10^9 years). Again, we see that this is very different from the other two timescales. These three timescales are the fundamental evolutionary timescales of stars, and as they differ significantly, it means that the rate of change of properties of a star can be very different depending on the nature of its evolution.","category":"page"},{"location":"2_equations_computational/","page":"Solving the Lane-Emden equation","title":"Solving the Lane-Emden equation","text":"EditURL = \"2_equations_computational.jl\"","category":"page"},{"location":"2_equations_computational/#Solving-the-Lane-Emden-equation","page":"Solving the Lane-Emden equation","title":"Solving the Lane-Emden equation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"2_equations_computational/","page":"Solving the Lane-Emden equation","title":"Solving the Lane-Emden equation","text":"TBD","category":"page"},{"location":"2_equations_computational/","page":"Solving the Lane-Emden equation","title":"Solving the Lane-Emden equation","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"2_equations_computational/","page":"Solving the Lane-Emden equation","title":"Solving the Lane-Emden equation","text":"This page was generated using Literate.jl.","category":"page"},{"location":"1_introduction_julia/#Julia-setup","page":"Julia setup","title":"Julia setup","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"1_introduction_julia/","page":"Julia setup","title":"Julia setup","text":"This class will include computational examples that are programmed in the julia programming language.
