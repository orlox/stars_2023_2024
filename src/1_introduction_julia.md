# Julia setup

This class will include computational examples that are programmed in the [julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language. Julia is a JIT (just-in-time) language which allows to write very fast code (very close to the performance of compiled languages like C and Fortran), while still having the simplicity of an interpreted language like python. Each of the examples included in this website can be downloaded as jupyter notebooks. The instructions below explain how to run these notebooks both in Linux and Windows systems.

## Linux

#### Download Julia

Get the version of julia that matches your system from the [downloads page](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Below instructions assume that:
- The version you downloaded is julia-1.9.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
- It was downloaded to your home folder, which should be something like `/home/USERNAME`.
You will need to adapt the commands below if that is not the case.

In a terminal, uncompress the file that has been downloaded by running the following commands:
```bash
# Move to the home directory
cd ~
# Uncompress the .tar.gz
tar zxvf julia-1.8.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```
This will create a folder called julia-1.9.2 in `/home/USERNAME`. You can find your executable in `/home/USERNAME/julia-1.9.2/bin/julia`.

#### Setup Julia

Julia can be started by running the executable, however using the full path to it is cumbersome. We can instead create an `alias` that will let us run the executable faster. This can be done by editing (or creating if it does not exist) the `.bashrc` file, which containts a set of commands that are run at the start of each terminal session. To edit the `.bashrc` file, I am going to use the `nano` text editor, but you can use your favorite text editor.

```bash
# Open the .bashrc file
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Copy and paste the following line at the bottom of the file:

```bash
alias julia=/home/USERNAME/julia-1.9.2/bin/julia
```

To save changes and exit from nano, you'll have to press `ctrl+X` , then `Y` to accept to save the modified buffer and then `enter`. Now, everytime you'll open a shell, you'll be able to call Julia by simply typing in a terminal

```bash
#Open Julia
julia
```
